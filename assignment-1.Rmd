The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

The number of registered private cars in Sweden for the years 1977 until February 2025, monthly data, is given in the second column of the file `carsmon.dat` at Studium.

Find a suitable ARIMA (or SARIMA) model for these data, or a transformation thereof. Analyze the model residuals carefully, in order to make sure that the model provides a good description of the data.

It might be a good idea to try transformations, like the logarithm.
